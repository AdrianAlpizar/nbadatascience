Python/Flask, web application using Request to scrape the NBA statistics website, along with Seaborn library with Matplotlib to display analytical data, graph, or use Pandas to analyze the data on user search.

Allows user-authentication with SQLAlechemy and sport chatroom built with Socket.io. Users may submit pictures of athletes as a search query, where I used a face recognition software for current LAL players, which then returns player stats as a normal text query would.
